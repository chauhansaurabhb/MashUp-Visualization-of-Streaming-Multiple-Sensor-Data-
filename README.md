# MashUp-Visualization-of-Streaming-Multiple-Sensor-Data-
This project represents good falvour of IoT as well as Data Visualization.This project contains five module, First module(Temperature Sensor)
generates simulated temperature sensor value,Second module(Proximity Sensor) generates  proximity value where Third & Fourth
modules are used to store temperature sensor value $ proximity data to database(MySQL).Fifth module provides support for MashUp-Visualization,
to provide real time visualization we used node.js, that priodically fetch data from database(MySQL) and display on browser.
